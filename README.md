# Based On: Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── ref/
    └── newsArchive.sol
├── src/
    └── lib/
        └── newsArchive.js
        └── newsArchiveABI.json
        └── newsArchive.sol
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Files in the `ref/` directory are intended as reference. In this example `newArchive.sol` will need to be deployed separately.

Files in the `src/lib/` directory are used as imports.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
